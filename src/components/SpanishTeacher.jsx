          Teaching Spanish through structure, clarity, and real-world use
        </h1>

        <p className="page-intro">
          I’ve taught Spanish to students of different backgrounds and levels,
          focusing on practical communication, confidence, and long-term retention.
        </p>

        <div className="page-section">
          <h2>Teaching approach</h2>
          <p>
            Lessons are structured but flexible, adapting to the student’s pace
            while keeping clear objectives and measurable progress.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="page-section">
          <h2>Focus on use, not theory</h2>
          <p>
            Emphasis on speaking, listening, and contextual understanding,
            rather than isolated grammar rules.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="page-section">
          <h2>Connection to my work today</h2>
          <p>
            Teaching reinforced my ability to break down complex ideas,
            communicate clearly, and design systems that support learning —
            skills I now use daily as a developer.
